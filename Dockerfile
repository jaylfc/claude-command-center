# Claude Command Center — trial install path.
#
# CCC's runtime is stdlib-only (see pyproject.toml: `dependencies = []`), so
# this image does NOT run `pip install`. Anything beyond the slim base is a
# bug — keep it that way.
#
# Caveats vs. the native `./run.sh` path on macOS:
#   - AppleScript "jump to terminal" no-ops (no osascript in Linux container).
#   - `--install-service` launchd agent does not apply.
#   - `attach`, Claude Desktop deep links, and other host-only glue do nothing.
#
# This image is for *evaluating* CCC. The kanban view + transcript ingestion
# work as long as ~/.claude is volume-mounted from the host (see compose file).
