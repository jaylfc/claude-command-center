# Claude Command Center

A local command center for Claude Code that doesn't care how your agents
were launched. Terminal sessions, headless processes, or spawned from the
dashboard — it latches onto all of them and lets you drop in and out of any
task to fix things.

## Why this exists

Most Claude Code orchestration tools are opinionated wrappers. They want to
own execution — you launch agents *through* them, and in return you get a
dashboard. That's fine until it isn't. The moment you open a terminal,
`claude --resume` something, and iterate on it by hand, you're outside the
tool's universe. The dashboard can't see it. The work you just did doesn't
show up on the kanban, against the issue, in the review queue.

This goes the other way. It treats Claude Code's on-disk state as the
source of truth — `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl` transcripts, the
`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` live registry, and per-tool-call sidecar
files written by two hooks we install into `~/.claude/settings.json`. If
Claude Code is running anywhere on your machine, it shows up here. If you
close the dashboard, your sessions keep running. If you open a terminal and
iterate by hand, the card updates.

The dashboard also knows how to *spawn* headless sessions (via
`claude -p --input-format stream-json`) and *resume* dormant ones on demand —
but those are additive. The thing it's built around is attaching to work
that already exists.

## Quickstart

Requirements: macOS, Python 3, and [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed.
Optional: [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) for GitHub integration, `vercel` for deploy status.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirfish1/claude-command-center
cd claude-command-center

# Try it — runs in the foreground until Ctrl-C / terminal close
./run.sh

# Keep it — install as a launchd agent that starts at login
./run.sh --install-service
```

Open [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090), then pick a repo from
the repo dropdown before starting repo-scoped actions.

`--install-service` writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.claude-command-center.plist`
and bakes in whatever `PORT` / `CCC_*` env vars were set when you ran it.
Re-run it to update config; remove with `./run.sh --uninstall-service`. Service
logs go to `~/.claude/command-center/logs/service.{out,err}.log`.

First launch (foreground or service) copies two hook scripts into
`~/.claude/command-center/hooks/` and registers them in
`~/.claude/settings.json`. After that, every Claude Code session on your
machine — terminal, headless, or dashboard-spawned — writes sidecar state
the UI uses for the kanban.

```

- **Session** — any Claude Code transcript on disk, alive or dormant.
- **Attach** — the server reads Claude's own files + sidecar state the
  installed hooks write after every tool call. Nothing to configure
  per-session.
- **Columns** — Backlog → Planning → Working → Review → In Testing →
  Verified / Inactive / Archived. Columns are derived from session state
  (live? commits? pushed? sidecar activity?), overridable by drag.
- **Backlog** — open GitHub issues + `TODO.md` entries, surfaced as cards
  next to your active sessions so everything lives on one board.

## Features

- **Kanban** across every session, with drag-drop between columns,
  rubber-band multi-select, and per-column tinting.
- **Split conversations** — drag any sidebar session onto the right or
  bottom edge of the open conversation to view two transcripts
  side-by-side, each with its own input bar. Closes back to single-pane
  with a click; collapses automatically below 900px.
- **GitHub integration** — start a session from an issue with one click
  (auto-adds `claude-in-progress` label + self-assigns). Verify closes the
  issue with a commit-SHA comment. Drag to Archived closes as "not
  planned". Issue body + comments render inside the dashboard (no iframe —
  GitHub blocks that).
- **Attach to existing sessions** — terminal `claude` processes show up
  automatically. Jump-to-terminal focuses them by TTY; rename/color the
  tab via Claude's own slash commands.
- **Open in Claude Desktop** (macOS) — third destination button beside
  Jump/Launch in the conversation toolbar; resumes the current CLI
  session inside the Claude Desktop app via the `claude://resume` deep
  link.
- **Headless spawn with follow-up** — launch `claude -p` sessions from the
  dashboard and keep talking to them via an in-browser input bar (no
  terminal needed, stdin pipe stays open).
- **Resume-on-demand** — injecting into a dormant session auto-spawns a
  headless `claude --resume` to deliver the message.
- **Auto-fix deploys** — optionally polls Vercel, spawns a `/fix-deploy`
  session on new production ERRORs (deduped by commit SHA).
- **AI-assisted titles** — click ✨ on any card to regenerate its title
  via `claude -p` (Haiku by default). Used for cleaning up auto-generated
  session slugs.

## Orchestration skill

CCC ships a Claude Code skill (`ccc-orchestration`) that lets one Claude
session spawn, inject into, and synchronously ask sibling sessions over
plain HTTP. On startup the server copies the skill to
`~/.claude/skills/ccc-orchestration/SKILL.md` (set
`CCC_SKIP_SKILL_INSTALL=1` to opt out) and writes its base URL to
`~/.claude/command-center/port.txt` so the skill can discover the running
instance without hardcoding a port.

Once installed, a Claude session can run e.g.:

```bash
CCC_URL="$(cat ~/.claude/command-center/port.txt)"
curl -s -X POST "$CCC_URL/api/ask" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "<uuid>", "text": "What is 2+2?", "timeout_ms": 30000}'
# -> {"ok": true, "text": "4", "cost_usd": ..., "duration_ms": ..., "num_turns": 1}
```

Use this for **persistent peer sessions** (a marketing assistant, a deploy
babysitter) that should survive past the current turn and show up on the
kanban — not for one-shot internal subtasks (the built-in `Task` tool is
better for those).

## Architecture

Two files: a single Python file (stdlib-only HTTP server) and a single HTML
file (vanilla JS, no framework, no build). State lives in JSON sidecar
files under `~/.claude/command-center/` — all human-readable, all rewriteable
by hand.

The server has no background workers. Every API request scans Claude's
session directories, merges in sidecar state, enriches with cached GitHub
issue data, and returns a flat list. The client classifies into columns
using rules like "has_push → Review", "live + sidecar_has_writes → Working".

Hooks are the only invasive thing. On first run the server copies
`hooks/post-tool-use.py` and `hooks/stop.py` to `~/.claude/command-center/hooks/`
and merges entries into `~/.claude/settings.json`. After that, Claude Code
fires them after every tool invocation, each hook writes a tiny JSON file
under `live-state/`, and the server reads those to answer "is this session
actually doing something right now or is it idle waiting for input?".

[`docs/session-attach.md`](docs/session-attach.md).

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8090` | HTTP port |
| `CCC_BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface to bind. Set to `0.0.0.0` to expose on the LAN — **no auth, see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)** |
| `CCC_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated origins (e.g. `http://my-mac.tailnet.ts.net:8090`) added to the same-origin POST allowlist. Use with `CCC_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` to reach the UI from another device on a trusted network (Tailscale / VPN) — **no auth, see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)** |
| `CCC_TRUST_TAILNET` | *(off)* | When set (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`), CCC shells out to `tailscale status --json` at startup and adds the local node's MagicDNS hostname + Tailscale IPs to the allowlist automatically. Same trust caveat as `CCC_ALLOWED_ORIGIN`. |
| `CCC_TITLE_STRIP` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated prefixes to strip from GitHub issue titles (e.g. `ACME,FOO` strips `[ACME ...]` and `[FOO ...]`) |
| `CCC_ORG_PATTERNS` | *(empty)* | Multi-tenant org-tagger. Format: `Label1:pat1a\|pat1b;Label2:pat2`. Each issue body is scanned and tagged with the first matching label so the UI can group backlog by org. |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT` | *(unset)* | Vercel project name. Leave empty to disable deploy polling. |

The `CCC_BIND_HOST`, `CCC_ALLOWED_ORIGIN`, and `CCC_TRUST_TAILNET` knobs can also be set in `~/.claude/command-center/network.json` so they survive shell restarts, or flipped from the **Network access…** entry in the sidebar settings popover. Env vars always win — useful for CI / one-shot overrides. The same security caveats apply: every trusted origin can run commands as you.

## Roadmap

**Shipped**
- Kanban over all live + dormant Claude Code sessions
- GitHub issue → session → verify → close pipeline
- Headless spawn with stdin-pipe follow-up
- Resume-on-demand
- Auto-fix-deploy (Vercel)
- AI title regeneration

**Not yet**
- Test suite. Zero tests today. The session classifier is where this hurts
  most.
- Non-Claude-Code agent runtimes. The ingestion layer would port to
  anything that writes structured transcripts (Aider, Gemini CLI, etc.),
  but adapters don't exist yet.
- Code split. `server.py` and `index.html` are each one huge file on
  purpose — you can read the whole product in an afternoon. That tradeoff
  bends eventually; it hasn't yet.

**Out of scope**
- Linux / Windows. The macOS-specific AppleScript glue is why attach and
  jump-to-terminal work end-to-end. Porting means stubbing those out.
- Multi-user / network-exposed mode. This is a local dev tool. If you're
  looking at it on a remote host, something has gone wrong.
- Electron / native wrap. Browser is the UI on purpose.
