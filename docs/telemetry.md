# Anonymous opt-in telemetry

CCC ships an **anonymous, opt-in, off-by-default** daily ping. This file
is the trust artifact. It describes the entire payload, the kill
switches, the consent flow, and the server-side contract. If anything
in the source diverges from this file, the source is buggy — open an
issue.

## TL;DR

- **Default state: OFF.** No bytes leave your machine unless you click
  **Enable** on the dashboard banner (or set the opt-in flag yourself).
- **Five fields**, all bounded — no free-form strings, no transcripts,
  no paths, no identity, no IP (server-side drop).
- **Inspectable locally.** Every piece of state lives in plain text
  under `~/.config/claude-command-center/`. Read it any time.
- **Kill switch at every layer:** env var, JSON file, or just delete
  the install-id file.

## What is sent

The complete schema-v2 payload, in JSON, posted once per UTC day to a
single HTTPS endpoint:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "install_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000",
  "version": "4.9.0",
  "platform": "darwin",
  "engines": "claude,codex",
  "last_active_date": "2026-06-07",
  "sessions_today": 4
}
```

| `schema_version`   | int    | `2`                                | constant in `server.py`; v1 omits `sessions_today` and is still accepted server-side  |

| `platform`         | string | `darwin` / `linux`                 | `sys.platform`                                                                        |
| `engines`          | string | `claude,codex,cursor,antigravity`  | which of {claude, codex, gemini, cursor, antigravity} binaries are on PATH            |

| `sessions_today`   | int    | `4`                                | count of `*.jsonl` files under `~/.claude/projects/` with mtime in the last 24h; capped at 100000 |

The HTTP request also carries:
- `User-Agent: claude-command-center/<version> (telemetry)`.
- `Content-Type: application/json`.

That's it for the opt-in daily ping. See the next section for the
separate, smaller, anonymous open beacon.

## Anonymous open beacon

Schema v2 introduced one additional endpoint — `POST /v1/open` — that
fires **once per server boot**, with the following 3-field body and
**nothing else**:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "version": "4.9.0",
  "platform": "darwin"
}
```

This beacon is **not** gated on the opt-in switch because it carries
**no `install_id`, no identifier of any kind**, and no engine list.
The aggregate it produces is "how many distinct CCC server boots
happened on a given UTC day"; an individual boot cannot be linked back
to anything else the same machine sends or to any prior boot from the
same machine.

It is still gated on the `CCC_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` env var — that single
switch is the user's guarantee that no bytes leave the host from this
process, regardless of opt-in state.

If you are uneasy about the beacon despite it carrying no identity,
set `CCC_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` before launching `server.py` / the
`.app` / `./run.sh`; it kills both the daily ping and the boot beacon.

## What is **never** sent

This is the trust anchor. The list is closed; expanding it is a major
version bump and a documented breaking change.

- Prompt content, transcripts, conversation events, tool calls, tool
  results, file contents.
- Usage volume, message counts, per-session timing, token counts, model
  names, costs. (Schema v2 added a single `sessions_today` integer — a
  count of `*.jsonl` files modified in the last 24h. That is the only
  usage-shaped field; everything else in this row remains off-limits.)
- Repo paths, repo names, branch names, file paths, cwd, project slug.
- User identity: name, email, hostname, username, login, IP address,
  git config, system locale.
- Errors, exception traces, stack traces, server log lines.
- Anything from the dashboard UI: clicks, keystrokes, searches,
  navigation, feature usage.

The server-side endpoint additionally drops the source IP **before**
logging the request. That drop happens in
[`infra/telemetry-worker/`](../infra/telemetry-worker/) — the source
ships with the rest of the repo so the guarantee is auditable. As of
this writing the Worker is **not yet deployed**; see
[`docs/telemetry-public.md`](telemetry-public.md).

## Kill switches

Three independent layers, in order of precedence. Any one wins.

1. **Env var.** Set `CCC_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` (also accepts `true`,
   `yes`, `on`, case-insensitive) before launching the server. With this
   set, the telemetry code path never runs — no install-id read, no
   dashboard bar, no background thread. This is the right knob for
   corporate fleets and CI runs.

2. **JSON file.** Open `~/.config/claude-command-center/telemetry.json`
   and set `"opt_in": false`. This is what the **Skip forever** button
   writes. The background thread reads this on every check (default once
   per hour).

3. **Delete the install-id.** Remove
   `~/.config/claude-command-center/install-id`. Without an id the
   payload can't be assembled and the ping is skipped; the dashboard
   bar will also re-appear on the next reload so you can confirm a
   fresh decision.

## State files

All under `~/.config/claude-command-center/` (mode `0700`):

- `install-id` — single line, a random UUIDv4 plus a newline. Mode `0600`.
  Generated only when the user opts in (or when this file is missing and
  a fresh opt-in is recorded). Cannot be reconstructed from machine
  identity.
- `telemetry.json` — opt-in state. Mode `0600`.
  ```json
  {
    "opt_in": true,
    "asked_at": "2026-05-19T14:23:01+00:00",
    "endpoint": "https://telemetry.claude-command-center.workers.dev/v1/ping"
  }
  ```
  `opt_in` is one of `null` (never asked), `true`, or `false`.
- `telemetry-last-ping` — single line, the UTC date of the last
  successful ping (YYYY-MM-DD). Mode `0600`. The daily cadence is
  enforced strictly from this file: if today's date is not strictly
  greater than the recorded date, no ping is sent.

## Cadence

- Background thread starts 30s after server boot (so the dashboard
  paints first), then checks every hour.
- Sends at most once per UTC day.
- Network: 15s total timeout, 10s connect timeout, **no retries**.
  Offline / DNS-fail / non-200 → silent skip; the next hourly check
  retries because the last-ping file wasn't updated.
- No retries on the same day. If the Worker is unreachable for 24h,
  that day's signal is simply lost — by design.

## Endpoints

- Daily opt-in ping: `POST https://telemetry.claude-command-center.workers.dev/v1/ping`.
- Anonymous open beacon (once per boot, no identity): `POST https://telemetry.claude-command-center.workers.dev/v1/open`.
- Override: set `CCC_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT=<url>`. The override is applied
  to **both** endpoints (`/v1/ping` is replaced with `/v1/open` for the
  beacon URL). Useful for staging, forking, or proxying through a
  fleet-managed collector.
- The Worker source is at
  [`infra/telemetry-worker/`](../infra/telemetry-worker/).

## Consent UX

The first time you open the dashboard with the server installed, a
small horizontal banner appears above the toolbar:

> _Help the maintainer know CCC is being used? Anonymous daily ping, 5
> fields, off by default._
>
> [Enable] [Skip forever] [What gets sent?]

- **Enable** → writes `opt_in: true` and generates the install-id.
  The first ping fires within the hour.
- **Skip forever** → writes `opt_in: false`. The bar never appears
  again (you can still flip the switch from a future Settings menu
  entry).
- **What gets sent?** → opens this file in a new tab.

Any of the three buttons dismisses the bar. The bar is `null`-state
only — once you've made a choice it never reappears unless you delete
the install-id.

## Implementation notes

- `server.py` is stdlib-only. Telemetry uses `urllib`, `json`, `uuid`,
  `pathlib`, `datetime` — nothing else. No pip dependencies at
  runtime.
- All telemetry log lines from `server.py` are tagged `[telemetry]`
  so you can grep them out:
  ```bash
  tail -f ~/Library/Logs/ccc.log | grep '\[telemetry\]'
  ```
- The endpoint URL the server will use is recorded in `telemetry.json`
  at opt-in time so a code-side endpoint change is visible in plain
  text on disk.

## Reporting concerns

If you find a leak — a field being sent that's not on the list above,
a kill switch that doesn't honor its contract, or a log line that
carries identifying data — open an issue (or email per `SECURITY.md`
for anything sensitive). This file is what we promise; deviations are
bugs, not features.
