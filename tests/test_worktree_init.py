"""Tests for the worktree env-setup hook (issue #47).

Isolated to its own file so it doesn't collide with sibling WIP in
test_smoke.py. Exercises the hook helper directly rather than driving a
full session spawn — we just want to prove the hook runs, exports the
documented env vars, and tolerates absent/failing scripts.
